# Bot Development Guidelines for Handling Sensitive Information

## Purpose

This document provides essential guidelines for all bot developers working with sensitive data. Adhering to these principles is critical for maintaining data integrity, confidentiality, and compliance with privacy regulations.

## 1. Data Minimization

* **Only collect what you need.** Design your bot to request and store the absolute minimum amount of sensitive information required to perform its function.
* **Anonymize or pseudonymize data whenever possible.** If the bot doesn't need to know a user's name, don't store it. Use unique, non-identifiable tokens instead.

---

## 2. Secure Storage and Handling

* **Encrypt everything.** All sensitive data, both at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being sent), **must be encrypted**. Use industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.2 or higher for transmission).
* **Avoid logging sensitive data.** The bot's logs should never contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive details. Configure logging systems to filter or redact this information automatically.
* **Limit data retention.** Establish a clear policy for how long the bot retains sensitive data. Delete this information as soon as it is no longer needed.

---

## 3. Access Control and Authentication

* **Implement the principle of least privilege.** The bot's account and any associated services should only have the permissions necessary to do its job. Do not give it admin privileges unless absolutely required.
* **Use robust authentication.** If the bot needs to authenticate with other systems, use secure methods like OAuth 2.0 or API keys stored in a secure secrets manager. Never hard-code credentials directly into the bot's code.

## 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

* **Never trust user input.** All data received from users must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) that could compromise sensitive data or the underlying systems.
* **Regular expression filters** are your friend. Use them to ensure input matches the expected format.

---

## 5. Auditing and Monitoring

* **Log all sensitive data access.** Create an audit trail for every action the bot takes that involves sensitive information. This is crucial for security incident investigations and compliance.
* **Set up alerts.** Configure monitoring to alert developers immediately of any suspicious activity, such as unusual data access patterns, authentication failures, or attempts to access unauthorized resources.

---

## 6. Regulatory Compliance

* **Understand the law.** Be aware of and build your bot in compliance with all relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA, depending on the type of data you're handling and your target audience.
* **Provide a clear privacy policy.** The bot's users should have easy access to a privacy policy that explains what data is collected, how it's used, and for how long it's stored.

---

## 7. Incident Response

* **Have a plan.** Be prepared for a potential security incident. Know the steps to take if the bot is compromised, including how to shut it down, notify users, and perform a forensic analysis.
